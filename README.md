### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

I'm Mike and I'm based in Bristol, UK.

Ccurrently working as Technical Lead for pi-topOS, the Raspberry Pi OS-based operating system for pi-tops.

I am an open-source contributor with a passion for developing novel solutions to real world problems.

My primary programming language in this role is Python, though I have experience with C/C++ (embedded and using high-level APIs such as Qt) as well as shell scripting.

I am interested in broadening my programming experience into web technologies.

#### pi-topOS

All of the software that I work on for pi-topOS is open source! This includes all workflows aorund software building and distribution.

A personal goal of mine is to continue to develop the tools that have been used to create pi-topOS into a suite of tools that can be used to easily manage a custom Raspberry Pi-based OS.
