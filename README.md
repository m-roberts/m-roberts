#### pi-topOS

My most significant project contributions to date are undoubtedly those produced as part of pi-topOS. All of the software that I worked on for pi-topOS is open source! This includes all workflows around software building & distribution.

A personal goal of mine is to continue to develop the tools that have been used to create pi-topOS into a suite of tools that can be used to easily manage a custom Raspberry Pi-based OS.
